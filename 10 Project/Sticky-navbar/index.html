         <h1>The Coffee Plant</h1>
    <p>
        Coffee originates from the fruit, called a cherry, of a flowering plant named Coffea. The "beans" we use are the seeds found inside this cherry. There are two primary species of coffee plants grown commercially:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Arabica (Coffea arabica):</strong> This is the most popular type, making up over 60% of the world's coffee. Arabica beans are known for their complex, aromatic, and less bitter flavor with higher acidity. They thrive in high-altitude, subtropical climates.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Robusta (Coffea canephora):</strong> Robusta beans have a stronger, bolder, and more "rubbery" taste with higher bitterness and about twice the caffeine content of Arabica. They are hardier plants that can grow in hotter climates. Robusta is often used in espresso blends and instant coffee.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Processing and Roasting</h2>
    <p>
        After the coffee cherries are harvested, the beans are extracted and dried using various methods. These green, unroasted beans have very little flavor. The characteristic taste of coffee is developed during roasting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Roasting is a heating process that transforms the chemical and physical properties of the green coffee beans. During roasting, sugars and amino acids combine in a process called the Maillard reaction, creating hundreds of different aromatic compounds that produce coffee's signature flavor and smell. The roast level—from light to medium to dark—dramatically affects the final taste. A light roast retains more of the bean's original, acidic flavors, while a dark roast brings out deeper, bitter, and roasted notes.
    </p>

    <h2>Brewing and Flavor</h2>
    <p>
        To make the drink, roasted coffee beans are first ground into smaller particles. Hot water is then used to extract the flavor compounds from the ground coffee. The method of brewing significantly impacts the taste. Popular methods include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drip Brew:</strong> Hot water slowly filters through a bed of ground coffee in a filter.</li>
        <li><strong>Espresso:</strong> A small, concentrated shot of coffee made by forcing pressurized hot water through finely-ground beans.</li>
        <li><strong>French Press:</strong> Grounds are steeped in hot water and then separated by plunging a mesh filter.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour-Over:</strong> A manual version of drip brew, offering more control over the brewing process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The key active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, a natural stimulant that works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired. This is what gives coffee its energizing effect. Beyond caffeine, coffee's flavor is a complex mix of acids, oils, and aromatic compounds, resulting in a wide spectrum of possible tastes, from fruity and floral to nutty and chocolatey.
